# Next.js Dashboard

This *used* to be my implementation of the generic tutorial project for the Next.js App Router Course ([course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn)), but with multiple enhancements and improvements, I'm happy to call it my own.

## Where does this differ from the original tutorial?

### **Customers Page**

This was previously absent in the tutorial. I added:

- Streaming customer data with partial pre-rendering and a loading skeleton
- A form to add new customers to the database, including validation and user feedback
- A form to edit existing customers in the database, including validation and user feedback
- Ability to delete existing customers, including user feedback
- An "image placeholder" component to display customer avatars without an image url
- Search functionality to filter customers by name or email
